# hyundai-meego
Repo for Hyundai/Genesis' Meego radio OS and sources. This project exists with the hope of possibly bringing CarPlay to an orphaned branch of hardware from 2015-2016. <br>
Most of the source files come from a 2015 Hyundai Genesis Ultimate with the 9.2" Jog Dial system<br>
The CarPlay source comes from the 2018 Genesis G80 Ultimate with the 9.2" Jog Dial system<br>
The 2015 Genesis.zip file is a compressed disk image containing the entire 2015 Meego OS, it unpacks to a little under 120GB. <br>
The same applies to the 2018 Genesis image. <br>
You can download both images below:<br>

Note: I'm not the developer of these packages, and code questions will likely be unresolved as I can barely code my way out of a wet paper bag.
